# Constraints Solver

Matt Keeter has a great post up (http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/constraints/) explaining how he created a constraints solver in Haskell for his CAD project. The interactive demos are a lot of fun to play with but I found the code examples difficult to follow. This project is my attempt to understand the method by implementing it in Swift.
